  values:
  - 'Hello!

    Welcome to Isolandia!'
  - Isolandia. A place where I isolate myself and make isometric games!
  - Can you believe this is my first isometric game!?! I can!
  - I really enjoyed making this! I spent way too many hours on it!
  - Kenney really has a lot of cool assets!
  - Get close to the flag to finish this level!
  - Here's how I made the characters!
  - '<b>Base Character:</b>

    I am a 3d object. But I got rendered to a Unity
    Render Texture!'
  - '<b>Criminal:</b>

    So, I am super smooth, but can interact and be hidden
    by all the isometricness!'
  - '<b>Cyborg:</b>

    Even my animations get rendered!'
  - '<b>Skater Boi:</b>

    Welp, get to the flag to see what''s next!'
  - Oh my gawd! Slopes were so hard! I spent 6 hours on this alone! And they still
    kinda suck! :P
  - So, rotation... huh... yeah, I got that covered too! Next level!
  - Elevation! Not just flat land! This is where it gets fun!
  - Per usual! Find the flag!
  - 'Use ROTATION to find the flag. Keyboard: Q/E, Joystick: L/R (It''s buggy though!)'
  - No, really! Use your rotation commands!! That's how you'll get to the next level!
  - Thanks for playing!
  - Sorry it was mostly a tech demo!
  - Hope it still inspired you!
  - 'Much Appreciated! The flag will take you back to main menu!

    - E.T.'
